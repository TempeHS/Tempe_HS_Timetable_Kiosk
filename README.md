# School Timetable Kiosk Application

## Overview

This is a configurable timetable kiosk application originally designed for Tempe High School but adaptable for any school. The app displays the current period's timetable in real-time.

## ðŸ”§ Configuration for Other Schools

**This app is now fully configurable!** See [`CONFIGURATION.md`](CONFIGURATION.md) for detailed instructions on how to customize the app for your school.

Key configurable features:
- School name and logo
- Colors and styling
- Period timing rules
- Sport period handling
- Year group configurations
- Ignored days (weekends, holidays)
- File names and paths

## CORS Policy and Local File Access

This timetable application requires access to local XML files. Due to browser security policies (CORS), you cannot simply open the `index.html` file directly in your browser. You need to run it through a local web server.

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Use the provided batch file (Windows)
1. Double-click `start-server.bat`
2. The script will automatically detect and use Python, Node.js, or PHP
3. Open your browser to `http://localhost:8000`

### Option 2: Manual server setup

**If you have Python installed:**
```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```
Then open: http://localhost:8000

**If you have Node.js installed:**
```bash
npx http-server -p 8000
```
Then open the URL provided in the terminal

**If you have PHP installed:**
```bash
php -S localhost:8000
```
Then open: http://localhost:8000

### Option 3: VS Code Live Server
1. Install the "Live Server" extension in VS Code
2. Right-click on `index.html`
3. Select "Open with Live Server"

## Required Files

Make sure these files are in the same directory:
- `index.html` (main application)
- `config.json` (school configuration - **NEW!**)
- `bell_times.xml` (period schedule data)
- `liss_info.xml` (lesson data)
- `calendar.xml` (calendar data for Week A/B determination)

## How It Works

The application automatically:
1. Loads the school configuration from `config.json`
2. Applies school-specific styling, colors, and logic
3. Loads the current period based on time and bell schedule
4. Checks if the current period has classes for configured year levels
5. If no classes are found, advances to the next period with classes
6. Displays the timetable with classes organized by year level
7. Handles special cases like sport periods with combined year groups

## Configuration Examples

The repository includes example configurations:
- `config.json` - Default Tempe High School configuration
- `config-example-riverside.json` - Example for a different school

## For Other Schools

1. **Copy the application files** to your server
2. **Create your `config.json`** based on the examples and [`CONFIGURATION.md`](CONFIGURATION.md)
3. **Update your XML data files** with your school's bell times, lessons, and calendar
4. **Customize colors and styling** to match your school branding
5. **Test and deploy**

The app will fall back to default settings if the configuration file cannot be loaded, ensuring it always functions.
5. Refreshes every minute to stay current

## Troubleshooting

**"CORS Error" or "Network Error":**
- You're trying to open the HTML file directly
- Use one of the web server options above

**"Error loading XML files":**
- Check that all XML files are present
- Verify file names match exactly (case-sensitive)
- Ensure files are not corrupted

**"No classes" showing when there should be classes:**
- Check the calendar.xml for correct date entries
- Verify the bell_times.xml has correct period definitions
- Ensure liss_info.xml has lessons for the current day/period
